## Overview

Modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) rely heavily on keyword matching.  
This often leads to:

- Strong candidates being rejected due to wording differences  
- Relevant skills being ignored if phrased differently  
- No intelligent explanation of skill gaps  

This project introduces a **Hybrid Resume Intelligence Engine** that combines structured matching with semantic similarity to create a smarter, explainable evaluation system.

## Core Idea — Hybrid Fusion Engine

Traditional systems only check for exact keyword matches.

This system evaluates resumes using:

1. **Exact Skill Matching (Structured Matching)**
2. **Related Skill Detection (Semantic Similarity using embeddings)**
3. **Hybrid Score Fusion**
4. **Category-based Skill Coverage Analysis**
5. **Priority-based Skill Gap Detection**
6. **Interactive Dashboard Visualization**

This creates a more intelligent and fair evaluation process.
